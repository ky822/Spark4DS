# Spark4DS

This repo holds the files for the "Spark for Data Scientists" presentation given at the Cornell Tech Hackathon on Feb. 13, 2016.

The src folder had the worksheets and one scala file for the code used in the demo. These can be incorporated into Eclipse for further testing and use. The file and folder pathnames need to be updated for your particular setup.

The data folder has the sample files for the demo plus a few others for practicing joins and augmenting the data sets. This data is also available on the transtats.bts.gov website as noted in the preso.

The example_plugins.sbt file should be saved as plugins.sbt in your plugins folder (see preso for an example filepath on macs.)

The preso should have the information necessary in the appendix to make use of these demo files.
